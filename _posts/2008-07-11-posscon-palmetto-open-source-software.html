<p><div class='p_embed p_image_embed'><img alt="Posscon" height="115" src="http://jasondew.files.wordpress.com/2008/07/posscon-scaled500.gif" width="120" /></div>I'll be speaking at the new South Carolina OSS conference in Columbia, SC on July 30th -- more details at <a>their website</a>.  I plan to talk about the open-source technologies that we use at the SC Budget and Control Board -- mostly Ruby on Rails and mySQL.  I'm pretty excited about the conference as its the first of its kind here in Columbia.  Should be worth coming to check it out -- oh, and did I mention its free to attend?  See you guys there!</p>
