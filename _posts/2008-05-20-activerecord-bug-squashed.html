<p><div class='p_embed p_image_embed'><img alt="Rails" height="111" src="http://jasondew.files.wordpress.com/2008/05/rails-scaled500.png" width="87" /></div>So we decided to use the new dirty record feature of Edge Rails to record the history of records in our new app at work.  Turns out that nullable integer fields are always dirty if their current value is NULL.  So, I submitted a patch and I'm honored to report that it was accepted and <a>committed into Rails</a>.  Its nice to be able to give back to the community.</p>
