<p>So based on some customer feedback on a project I'm currently working on, I added a validation requiring that one of the dates be in the past.  The validation is pretty straightforward:</p><p><a href="http://gist.github.com/188474">http://gist.github.com/188474</a></p><p>After re-running the test suite though, I got a couple of failures.  After digging into the code, it turns out that the following code snippit evaluates to true!</p><p><a href="http://gist.github.com/188475">http://gist.github.com/188475</a></p><p>Of course this makes no sense.  What's more is that I tried the code again while writing this blog post and now its false.  So I did some digging into the Ruby internals and it turns out that Time#&lt; is implemented in C in the following method:</p><p><a href="http://gist.github.com/189385">http://gist.github.com/189385</a></p><p>The best I can come up with is that there's an problem with the GetTimeval method since its just a macro that pulls out some data from a time struct -- but the Date class is implemented in pure Ruby.  Anyone come across this or can explain better?</p>
