<p>
  So I've been working on the <a href="http://github.com/jasondew/darwin/tree/master">Darwin</a>
  hobby project again recently and decided to find out where the program is spending all of
  it's time.  It turns out that there are some
  <a href="http://book.realworldhaskell.org/read/profiling-and-optimization.html">really nice profiling tools</a>
  in Haskell (GHC to be specific).  Armed with that, I found out rather quickly
  that the bottleneck was the getPixel function I added to the GD bindings.
</p>

{% gist 470216 %}

<p>
  My first thought was that it would be nice to grab all of the pixels at
  once instead of repeated (slow) calls to getPixel.  So I read up on Haskell FFI
  and the GD documentation and churned out the following:
</p>

<p>
  This code returns a nice Haskell array of arrays with the color information.
  This improved the speed from 1 minute per 10 iterations to 1 second per 10
  iterations -- about a 60x improvement!
</p>

<p>
  However, this only works with true color images at this point; no indexed
  palette support since that information gets stored elsewhere in the GD image
  struct.  All in all, it was a very pleasant and rewarding experience into
  Haskell.  Next on the list is (Erlang-style maybe?) parallelization.
</p>

<p>
  BTW, the GD binding code is under the dependencies folder
  <a href="http://github.com/jasondew/darwin">here</a>.
