<p>I've been teaching a Statistics course at USC for a few years now and so, being the geek that I am, I decided a couple of semesters ago to write some course management software in Rails.  I've worked on it on and off since then and I would consider it to be in a semi-usable state at this point.  I've used it in my last two semesters without major problems.</p><p>The features at this point are</p><ul><li>course announcements</li><li>course documents</li><li>ability to assign multiple choice quizzes</li><li>quiz statistics, including per question</li><li>ability to add exam grades</li></ul><p>The source is available at <a href="http://github.com/jasondew/learnstat">http://github.com/jasondew/learnstat</a>.  Please send any bug reports or feature requests to jason.dew at gmail.</p>
