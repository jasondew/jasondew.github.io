Listening to Matz at RubyConf 07 made me reminisce about how I got started programming.  He was asked "do you consider yourself to be a scientist or an artist?" to which Matz responded: "a hobbyist."  Ruby was just a hobby to him, something he found to be fun and fulfilling.  Its kind of the same way I made it into full-time web development.  Its what I did on the side because I enjoyed it.  Now I feel privileged that I have a job where I can do what I love most of the time.  It's nice to find commonalities with people that you respect.</p>
