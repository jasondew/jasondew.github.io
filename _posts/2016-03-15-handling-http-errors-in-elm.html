<article class="markdown-body entry-content" itemprop="text">
  <p><strong>Expected knowledge:</strong> Basics of Elm and the Elm Architecture</p>
  <p><strong>Read to learn:</strong> How to handle HTTP errors in Elm</p>
  <p>I remember one of the things I struggled with writing my first Elm program (other than writing a JSON decoder) was dealing with non-successful HTTP responses. I've heard the question asked a few times in the Elm Slack channel and decided that I would share how I solved the problem. I'll assume that you're following the Elm Architecture.</p>
  <p><strong>Status Quo</strong></p>
  <p>Let's start by looking at the signature of the <code>Http.get</code> function:</p>
  {% gist fcbdfd4935e0b88ab693 %}
  <p>What we need out of this is an <code>Effects Action</code> to return in our <code>update</code> function. Here's how things might look to start with:</p>
  {% gist e1172220dfbfd98845e2 %}
  <p>This works great except that we throw away information about the failure case. We either get a <code>Just Response</code> or <code>Nothing</code>!</p>
  <p><strong>Retaining Error Information</strong></p>
  <p>Let's see how we can do better. First, we need to change our <code>Updated</code> action to account for errors by accepting a <code>Result</code> that can contain either an <code>Error</code> or a <code>Response</code>:</p>
  {% gist 9dd14cad30e0a9fae891 %}
  <p>Then we can update our request function to send the errors along as well:</p>
  {% gist 7892e8076a4fea4006db %}
  <p>Our update function will need to change as well to accomodate the extra information we're passing along:</p>
  {% gist 9a08d89d41e00871a91f %}
  <p>This is a big step forward! Now we can update our UI to reflect the fact that something's gone wrong or log the failure to the console.</p>
  <p><strong>An Alternative Approach</strong></p>
  <p>If we want, though, we can also have a generic error action that we can reuse. Here's what that approach would look like:</p>
  {% gist d83343901d15b1e8c142 %}
  <p>Of course, instead of just logging the errors to the console we can show the user an error state, retry, or anything else! I hope this helps but if not, ping me on the Elm slack channel.</p>
