<p><div class='p_embed p_image_embed'><img alt="Monalisa" height="202" src="http://jasondew.files.wordpress.com/2009/02/monalisa-scaled500.jpg" width="250" /></div>Had some fun this weekend writing Haskell in response to <a href="http://rogeralsing.com/2008/12/07/genetic-programming-evolution-of-mona-lisa/">this blog post</a>.  Code is on <a href="http://github.com/jasondew/darwin/tree/master">GitHub</a>.  It has some performance issues and its really my first real program in Haskell, so its a little rough around the edges, I'm sure.  I think I'll rewrite it in Erlang to see if I can't speed it up a good bit by parallelizing the fitness function and increase the generation pool.</p>
