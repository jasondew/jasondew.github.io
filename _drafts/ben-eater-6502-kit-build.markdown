title:  Building Ben Eater's 6502 Kit

I recently discovered Ben Eater's excellent [video
series](https://eater.net/6502) on building a 6502-based computer on a
breadboard. I've done a bit of hardware stuff before, but mostly on the level
of Raspberry Pis, so this was intriguing. I ordered the Clock Module first and
was able to get that to working without much trouble. It's amazing how
satisfying just getting an LED to blink at different speeds is! The star of
this circuit is definitely the 555 timer, which I took a detour to study for a
bit. I even ordered a fun [kit from
EvilMadScientist.com](https://shop.evilmadscientist.com/652) but I haven't
assembled it yet!
